# Modern Web Development with Kotlin

This is the companion code repository for the [Modern Web Development with Kotlin](https://leanpub.com/modern-web-development-with-kotlin) I'm currently writing.

## Staring point

The [`starting-point`](https://github.com/denisftw/modern-web-kotlin/releases/tag/starting-point) tag marks the initial state of a model application that is used throughout the book for demonstrating different aspects of Web development. In particular the book illustrates the following:

* Building a Web application on top of [Vert.x](http://vertx.io/)
* Querying remote services with the [Fuel](https://github.com/kittinunf/Fuel)
* Using [Kovenant](https://github.com/mplatvoet/kovenant) Promises for doing asynchronous tasks
* Using [Gradle](https://gradle.org/) for enabling efficient workflow
* Integrating Vert.x with [React](https://facebook.github.io/react/) and [Webpack](https://webpack.github.io/)
* Working with JSON

## Versions used

The code uses Vert.x 3.3.2 and Kotlin 1.0.3
